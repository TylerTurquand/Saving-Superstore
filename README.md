## Overview

This project entails a comprehensive analysis of a superstore's operational performance across multiple key dimensions. The results aim to offer suggestions to improve the superstore's profitability and save it from bankruptcy.

## The Process

In Part 1, the focus was on identifying profit and loss centers by analyzing various pairs of dimensions, like region and category. Bar graphs were utilized to justify conclusions and determine products and product subcategories that should be discontinued or emphasized. 
Part 2 delves into assessing the viability of advertising by identifying optimal state-month combinations for maximum return on ads. Bar graphs were used to find the top three states based on highest average revenue. These three states were then further analyzed to find the most profitable months in each state. 1/5th of the average profit of the best month for each state was used as the recommendation for the maximum amount the superstore should spend on ads there.
Part 3 involves analyzing return rates of products and customers to determine potential anomalies and their impact on profitability. Visualizations are employed to provide insights into the relationship between average profit and return rates.

## Results
### Part 1 
The two biggest loss centers were found in the central region of the United States: Furniture and Office Supplies. Furniture, specifically tables and bookcases, caused the biggest losses.

The two biggest profit centers were found in the Western Region: Office Supplies and Technology. Technology, like copiers, phones, and their accessories brought the most positive revenue.

It was advised to stop selling any items with a loss of $1,000 or more as an intital change to store inventory. A stronger focus on techonlogy items was suggested as well.

### Part 2
The top three states to focus advertisement on were determined by highest generated revenue for each state and month, and are as follows:

Indiana - Best Month: October, maximum ad spend: $128.63

### Part 3
Return rates were found for individual products and customers. However, after further analysis, it was shown that there wasn't much of a correlation between average return rates and average revenue per category.
